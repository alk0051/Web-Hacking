<h2>What is OAuth?</h2>

<p>OAuth is a commonly used authorization framework that enables websites and web applications to request limited access to user's
account on another application. Crucially, OAuth allows the user to grant this access without exposing their login credentials to the
requesting application. This means users can fine-tune which data they want to share rather than having to hand over full control of
their account to a third party
